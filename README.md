# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (C++ Minimax + Alpha-Beta Pruning)

A C++ implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game, featuring an AI opponent powered by the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta pruning** for efficiency.  
This project supports multiple game modes, making it fun for casual play and a great study resource for AI/game theory enthusiasts.
°°° First, I wrote some comments in the code to explain it , so u can read the code directly because it more organized.

## ✨ Features
- **Game Modes**
  - 👥 Player vs Player
  - 🤖 Player vs AI (Easy – random moves)
  - 🤖 Player vs AI (Hard – Minimax + Alpha-Beta pruning)
  - 🤖 vs 🤖 AI vs AI

- **AI Difficulty**
  - *Easy*: Random moves for a relaxed experience.
  - *Hard*: Optimal moves using Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning (unbeatable).

- **C++ Implementation**
  - Single-file project: `tic-tac-toe-GAME-AI.cpp`
  - Efficient use of algorithms and clean modular design.

## 🧠 How the AI Works
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Simulates all possible moves and outcomes to choose the best strategy.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes Minimax by eliminating branches that don’t affect the final decision, reducing computation time.

This ensures the AI plays perfectly in *Hard Mode* and cannot be beaten (only tied).
